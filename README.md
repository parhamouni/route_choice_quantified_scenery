 ## A Pedestrian Route Choice Model Concerning Quantified Built Environment Factors
 Parham Hamouni,

This thesis builds on a growing body of research that seeks to understand how the built-in
environmental attributes of the road network influence pedestrian route choice. Better understanding
of these factors can help promotion of walkability. The thesis uses a high-quality GPS dataset of
pedestrian trips recorded between October 17 to November 21, 2016, through the MTL Trajet app
developed at Concordia University. Trip route characteristics are obtained by matching the GPS traces
to a detailed GIS network dataset of road attributes. Additionally, built-in environment factors were
captured by scenery quantification and micro-level land use analysis using Google Places API. Scenery
was quantified by employing computer vision and machine learning techniques, with help of Google
Street View API and deep learning frameworks. A path-size multinomial logit model is used to assess
the utility of road and user features. Additionally, to improve prediction accuracy, a set of supervised
learning classification techniques, including decision tree, random forest and gradient boosting tree
were examined. The analysis of the results shows that the variation in scenery has a significant impact
on pedestrians route choice. Additionally, machine learning classification techniques showed
significant improvement of the accuracy ratio in comparison to discrete choice modeling framework.

These are the sample codes we used to do the analysis, in which we used machine learning classifiers, huge data processing and discrete choice modeling with Python Biogeme.
